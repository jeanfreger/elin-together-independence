///     active, the date of the world stands still: no hour, no day, no waiting or resting passing time. The host
///     counts as a player only when it is not away from the keyboard (PlayerIdle); the game of an always-on server
///     (-empserver) never does. Its world is paused (PauseGame) and GameDate.AdvanceMin does nothing
///     (WorldDateAdvanceEvent), except a catch-up with what a player made pass elsewhere. <br />
///     The same for a map a player holds alone, away from the host: nobody lives it while that player is away
///     from the keyboard, its clock stops too
